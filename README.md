## 📁 Repository Overview

This repository (**tmps_x**) contains all laboratory works completed for the **TMPS** course.  
Each lab focuses on a different category of software design principles or patterns, gradually increasing in complexity.

The labs cover:

- SOLID principles  -  tmps_1/
- Creational Design Patterns - tmps_2/
- Structural Design Patterns - tmps_3/
- Behavioral Design Patterns - tmps_4/

This consolidated repository gathers all TMPS labs into one unified structure.



## 📦 Project Structure
Overview

All laboratory works completed throughout this course (creational, behavioral, and structural design patterns) were developed using a single consistent project: the Coffee Ordering System (🥐☕ Local Bistro). Each laboratory extends the same system by adding new functionalities, improving its architecture, and applying different categories of design patterns. The Coffee Ordering System serves as the common foundation on which all design pattern implementations were built, ensuring continuity, reusability, and clear demonstration of how each pattern contributes to a scalable and maintainable software solution.
